# Package sources and the cache

## Sources

Two public, anonymous, plain-HTTP package directories are searched by
default:

| Source                                                    | Packages |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `download.ni.com/evaluation/labview/lvtn/vipm/index.vipr` | ~2,530   |
| `www.jkisoft.com/packages/jkisoft.ogpd`                   | ~2,290   |

Both are OGPM's Package Directory format, `[Package <name>-<version>]`
sections with a `Package.URL`, unchanged since `openg.ogpd` in 2004; `.vipr`
adds an MD5 per entry. Anything they lack can come from an index folder of
your own, named in the manifest's `[sources]` (see
[manifest.md](manifest.md#sources)). A `[sources]` entry is an
`http://` or `https://` folder holding an `index.vipr`. Local directories of
`.vip` files are configured globally with `lvpm config set sources.local`
instead (see [configuration.md](configuration.md)); lvpm reads their specs and
package files directly. These local directories reuse cached spec metadata
when file size and modification time match; installation still reads their
original archives unless imported.

## The cache

Use `lvpm cache add` to import a `.vip` or `.ogp`, or all such files directly
inside a directory, into the shared content-addressed cache:

```powershell
lvpm cache add D:\LabVIEW\Packages\some_lib-1.2.3.vip
lvpm cache add D:\LabVIEW\Packages
lvpm --refresh cache add D:\LabVIEW\Packages
```

Imports record SHA-256, MD5, package metadata, and the original path. Repeated
imports skip unchanged files when their cached blob still exists; `--refresh`
reads and hashes them again. Imported packages are available to search and
installation even after the originals are deleted. Cache reads verify the
SHA-256 and installation also checks MD5. Local index files and cache
list/remove/prune commands are not implemented yet.

Remote package installs check the cache by name, version, and the feed's MD5
before downloading. A single distinct SHA-256 match is verified and reused,
including archives imported from disk. Missing, corrupt, or ambiguous matches
are downloaded and verified, then stored with SHA-256 and MD5 for future runs.
Packages without a feed MD5 are stored but downloaded again on later installs:
name/version alone does not identify their bytes. `--refresh` refreshes feeds,
not already verified package blobs. Dry runs may populate the cache without
writing package files into the target.

Remote feeds, downloads, and imported packages are recorded in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\lvpm\cache`, in a
SQLite index (`lvpm-cache.db`) over a content-addressed store of the bodies
themselves. For feed bodies, without `--refresh` the stored body is used and
no feed request goes out. With it, the `ETag` and `Last-Modified` the server last gave
are sent back as a conditional request: only a feed that actually changed is
downloaded again, and an unchanged one answers `304` and costs no bytes. See
[configuration.md](configuration.md) to move the cache, and
[cache-design.md](cache-design.md) for its design.
